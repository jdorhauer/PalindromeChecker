# PalindromeChecker

## About

This is a fun little challenge, providing me the opportunity to stay sharp on my skill.

The application takes input from the user and checks if that input is the same backwards as it is forwards. A message is displayed that affirms or denies that this is true.

## Framework

It was built as a .NET Core console application.

## Viewing

In order to view this, users must download and run the application locally.

As with my other projects, I am looking into purchasing a domain, as well as hosting options that would open up.
